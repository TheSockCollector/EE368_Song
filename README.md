# EE 368 – MIDI Note Synthesis and Envelope Modulation
Authors: Luke Oliver, Paul Montgomery, Samuel Weston

This MATLAB project generates musical notes based on MIDI numbers and simulates the sound of a piano-like instrument by combining harmonics extracted from a real `elecpiano.wav` sample.  
Each note is synthesized as a sum of harmonics and shaped with an exponential **attack–decay envelope** to create a more natural, “reverby” sound.

We used these functions to create the song Subwoofer Lullaby from Minecraft

The matlab files employed are:
- play_note.m
- Subwoofer_Lullaby.m
- DFSmodified.m
- myCos.m
